# GPON-Network-Visualization

This is a four part miniseries of some of the most interesting (according to my experience) visualizations for GPON networks (and telecommunications KPI in general).


## First visualization
Is a modified heat map to resemble the front of an OLT.

## Second visualization
Is a scatter plot of the occupation of the PON port vs the client quantity inside the same PON port.

## Third visualization
Is a blubble plot of the average client speed vs the quantity of client per OLT.

## Fourth visualization
Is a compound visualization of two histograms, and a scatter plot, that help you see the relationship between the optical receiving power at the ONT, and the distance to said ONT.
