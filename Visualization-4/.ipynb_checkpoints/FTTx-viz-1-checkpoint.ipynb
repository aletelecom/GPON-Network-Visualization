    "## Sankey as connection flow visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "   As a continuation of my series of visualizations in GPON networks today's post will explore how to use a __Sankey visualization__ to plot the flow of interconnections between an OLT (Optical Line Terminal) and several ODFs (Optical Distribution Frames) in a FTTx installation. Sankey diagrams are a powerful tool to visualize complex systems and processes, and they are particularly useful in showing the flow of energy, materials or information. By the end of this post, you will have a better understanding of how to use Sankey diagrams to visualize the flow of interconnections in your FTTx installation and how to use them to identify areas of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration and main code for today´s viz comes from a post by __Mattia Cinelli__ on [How to do a Sankey Plot in Python](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-do-a-sankey-plot-in-python-5298869f5e8e).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get some context, the ODN is used to distribute the optical signal from the OLT PON port, to the final client's ONT (Optical Network Terminal) device, which allows the customer to enjoy triple play services at their homes, you can see a simple diagram [from Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GPON_topology.png):\n",

    "As seen in the image, the Inside plant (__GPON Network__) and Outside Plant (__FTTx Network__) have to \"come together\" somewhere, and that interconnection is very important for both networks, and sometimes, and in some teams its: \"Nobody's land\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this article is that you get an overview of both the smoothness or lack of in the interconnections of both your networks, and how we'll use a __Sankey Plot__ as a proxy to visualize this phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to make this visualization, I'm going to suppose that you have the inventory information about each OLT, and it's PON port connection to an Outside Plant FTTx ODF (Optical Distribution Frame) on every CO (Central Office) of your network, with this you'll be able to reproduce the visualizations that I'll present here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information, if you think about it, could be represent as __Edges__ in a __Graph__, having the OLT and the ODF as the __Nodes__ that this edge interconnect. So, to help us create a synthetic dataset, let’s use the Python library called __NetworkX__, which is very helpful when working with data that can be represented as a graph, you can check it here: [NetworkX documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html)"

    "* The first thing to point out is that the plots you will get from your data, will look significantly more different than this one.\n",
    "* For starters, we used an auxiliary function from the library __\"NetworkX\"__ to create the edges, more specifically the graph constructor called __\"G = nx.complete_graph(100)\"__, which creates a fully connected graph, which means that all the nodes are connected to each other (but themselves).\n",
    "* Now what you might see in your plots will reflect how smooth or not your __\"FTTx\"__ network deploy in that specific Central Office.\n",
    "* More specific, you might see some ODFs receive most of the flows from most of the OLTs. This could mean that a particular ODF is connected to many Outside Plant cables.\n",
    "* Another thing you might see is the concentration of flows on a particular node.\n",
    "* And if you have a Central Office which might have got many FTTx deploy projects over a long period of time, the flows could be very chaotic. \n",
    "\n",
    "This plot will surely help you identify crams in your network, or let you know how many COs are clean regarding their installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately you will have a depper understanding in the relationships of the interconnections between your GPON and FTTx networks in a visual way, and in turn, could help you take better and more well-informed decision in your future Inside Plant deploy project design.\n",
